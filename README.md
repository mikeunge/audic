# audic

Small audio-controller for pulseaudio written in go.

### About

'audic' is a small cli wrapper that uses 'pactl' under the hood.
This tool makes it really easy to interact with pulseaudio via the pactl.

If you find any _bugs_ or you got a _feature_ you'd need, create a pr and I'll try to implement/fix it.
